Welcome

Welcome to this interactive Slurm tutorial.
In this tutorial you will be guided through the process of using Slurm.
We will go through how to get information about the system, how to see the current job queue, and how to put your own jobs in the queue.
The arrows in the bottom right corner are used to navigate the tutorial pages where this welcome page is the first.
This tutorial assumes that you know how a terminal works. If not then you will need to find a tutorial.
